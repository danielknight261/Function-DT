Alternatively, CD into my-app and run npm run dev in the terminal for http://localhost:3000

Notes: This was a really fun project to build using familiar technology. The responsiveness needs some adjustments, but overall it's close to the Figma design. Added some simple state to allow the burger menu to open and close. Overall, it wouldn't take much work to complete the project.
